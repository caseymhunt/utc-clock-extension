What it's not\r\n3. Installation\r\n4. Feature Requests\r\n\r\n==================\r\n\r\n1. What it is\r\nUTC Clock is an extension developed for Google Chrome. It is intended to be very simple with one very specific function:\r\nShow the current Universal Time\r\n\r\n2. What it's not\r\nUTC Clock is not intended to be anything more than a simple reference utility to quickly determine the current time in Universal Time (or Greenwich Mean Time, as it's sometimes referred to).\r\n\r\nIt will not ever show you current local time or attempt to be anything as complicated as some other time zone extension/utilities similar to FoxClocks for Firefox. \r\n\r\n3. Installation\r\nThe easiest method of installation, and preferred method, is through the Chrome Web Store. Not only will this automate the installation process, but it will also keep your extension up to date with any future changes that may be necessary. \r\n\r\nThe extension may be installed [from it's page](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gmtutc-clock/lkiboebkhioapbcogmjkkjbpgbgjlodj) on the Chrome store. \r\n\r\n4. Feature Requests\r\nPlease contact me via [my GitHub profile page](http://github.com/caseymhunt)- I'd love to hear what you'd like done. Or feel free to fork the project and make the changes yourself!\r\n","google":"","tagline":"UTC Clock - Chrome Extension"}
