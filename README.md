UTC Clock - Chrome Extension

==================

1. What it is
UTC Clock is an extension developed for Google Chrome. It is intended to be very simple with one very specific function:
Show the current Universal Time

2. What it's not
UTC Clock is not intended to be anything more than a simple reference utility to quickly determine the current time in Universal Time (or Greenwich Mean Time, as it's sometimes referred to).

It will not ever show you current local time or attempt to be anything as complicated as some other time zone extension/utilities similar to FoxClocks for Firefox. 

3. Installation
The easiest method of installation, and preferred method, is through the Chrome Web Store. Not only will this automate the installation process, but it will also keep your extension up to date with any future changes that may be necessary. 

The extension may be installed from the following URL:
https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gmtutc-clock/lkiboebkhioapbcogmjkkjbpgbgjlodj

4. Feature Requests
Please feel free to request features or changes to the extension on the reviews section in the Chrome Web Store or in comments here on Github. I entertain all ideas and will do my best to implement.
